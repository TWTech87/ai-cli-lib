.SH NAME
.B ai_readline
\- Configuration file format

.SH SYNOPSIS
The operation of
.BR ai_readline (7)
is controlled by ini-style
configuration files
searched in the order specified in the
.I FILES
section of library's manual page.

.SH DESCRIPTION
Configuration files are searched and loaded in the specified order.
Entries in configuration files read later can override previous ones.
In general, system-wide configuration files are used to specify
default behaviors,
while user configuration files are used for individual tailoring,
such as the specification of the API key or prompts for commands
that are not supported by default.

The following sections describe the supported contents of each
configuration file section.
All section names and options are specified in lowercase.

.SH [PROMPT] SECTION OPTION
.PP
\fIsystem=\fR
.RS 4
The system prompt specifying to context through which the
LLM prompting is made.
A single
.I %s
sequence is replaced when the prompt is sent out as an API request
by the name of the command being executed
(e.g.
.IR mysql ).
.RE

.PP
\fIcontext=\fR
.RS 4
The number of previous commands that will be provided as context.
More context can provide better responses,
but also increases the operation's cost.
.RE

.SH [BINDING] SECTION OPTIONS
.PP
\fIvi=\fR
.RS 4
The single-letter vi movement key on which the AI help is bound.
It can be used when vi key bindings are in effect.
.RE

.PP
\fIemacs=\fR
.RS 4
The Emacs key sequence on which the AI help is bound.
It is specified using
.BR readline (5)
format.
It can be used when Emacs key bindings are in effect.
.RE

.SH [OPENAI] SECTION OPTIONS
These options tailor the behavior of the OpenAI
queries.
Refer to the 
.UR "https://platform.openai.com/docs/models"
OpenAI API documentation
.UE
for more details.

.PP
\fIendpoint=\fR
.RS 4
The URL of the API endpoint.
.RE
.PP
\fImodel=\fR
.RS 4
The OpenAI model to use, e.g.
.IR gpt-3.5-turbo .
This affects performance and pricing.
.RE

.PP
\fItemperature=\fR
.RS 4
The sampling temperature to use as a value between 0 and 2.
Higher values, such as 0.8, will make the output more random,
while lower values, such as 0.2, will make it more focused and deterministic.
.RE

.PP
\fIkey=\fR
.RS 4
OpenAI API access key.
Ensure this is specified in a configuration file that is not readable
by entities unauthorized to make OpenAI API requests with the given key.
.RE

.SH [PROMPT-] SECTION OPTIONS
A series of sections starting with
.B prompt-
followed by the name of a program,
such as
.B bash
or
.B mysql
are used to provide multishot example prompts
for improving the obtained responses.
These are provided by
.B ai_readline
at the beginning of each API request.

.PP
\fIuser-n=\fR
.RS 4
A user prompt in natural language.
The \fIn\fP placeholder can take values 1-3.
.RE

.PP
\fIassistant-n=\fR
.RS 4
The ideal response to the user prompt for the program being
specified in the corresponding section.
.RE

.SH EXAMPLE
.RS
.nf
[prompt]
system = You're an assistant providing executable commands for %s.
context = 3

[openai]
endpoint = https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
model = gpt-3.5-turbo
temperature = 1.0
key = sk-hjgds5hljfgs8dfw4ljghljfhfFER344FFFggf84fssddG4k

[binding]
vi = V
emacs = \\C-xa

[prompt-bash]
user-1 = List files in current directory
assistant-1 = ls
user-2 = What is the current time and date?
assistant-2 = date
.RE
.fi
