.SH NAME
.B ai_readline
\- AI enhancement for interactive command-line programs

.SH SYNOPSIS
Set the
.B LD_PRELOAD
environment variable to load the library using its full path.
Obtain your OpenAI API key and configure it in the
.B .airlconfig
file.
Run the interactive command-line programs, such as
.BR bash ,
.BR mysql , 
.BR psql , 
.BR gdb ,
as you normally would.
To obtain AI help,
enter a prompt and press
.B "^X-a"
(Ctrl-X followed by a)
in the (default)
.B Emacs
key binding mode or
.B V
if you have configured
.B vi
key bindings.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ai_readline
library detects programs that link against
.BR readline (3)
and modifies their interface to allow obtaining help from OpenAI's
generative pre-trained transformer large language model (LLM).
Specifically,
it creates a
.BR readline (3)
function named
.BR query_ai ,
and binds it to (configurable)
.BR Emacs
and 
.BR vi
keys.
When the corresponding key or key sequence is pressed,
suitable prompts are sent to the OpenAI API endpoint,
and the prompt is replaced with the obtained response.
(The prompt is added in the command-line history for further editing.)
The LLM query contains context from previous commmands
(but not their output),
which allows prompts to refine commands as needed.

The syntax to force preload of the library according to the shell
is as follows.

Bash, Ksh and the traditional Bourne shell:

export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/ai_readline.so

C Shell:

setenv LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/ai_readline.so

The setting can be made permanent by adding the command
to a shell's configuration file, such as
.BR .bashrc ,
.BR zshrc ", or"
.BR .cshrc .

The operation of
.B ai_readline
can be configured through the files 
listed in the
.I FILES
section and the format documented in
.BR ai_readline (5).

.SH BUGS
.B ai_readline
will not work with programs that are linked statically with
.BR readline (3)
rather than using it as a shared library object.
